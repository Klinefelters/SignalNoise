# Signal Noise Filtering
The goal of this project is to allow the user to simulate a signal with a variaty of noises added to it, and attempt to filter it.

# Filter Types
Currently, the program uses a [Butterworth Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterworth_filter) twice, once forwards and once in reverse.

# Signal Creation
The program uses the compact fourier series and allows the user to input a list of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases.

# Noise Types
The program has 3 options for noise: gausian, impulse, and random. It also allows the user to control the noise intensity.

# TODO
- Add more filter types
- Make signal creation easier
